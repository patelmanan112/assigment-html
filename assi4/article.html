    <h1 style="text-align: center;"> History of Computer </h1>
    <br>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Early computer</h2>
    <p>
        Early computers were very different from the modern devices we use today. The earliest forms, like the <b>abacus</b>, were simple tools for calculation, and later mechanical designs such as Charles Babbage’s Analytical <strong>Engine</strong> in the 1800s laid the foundation for programmable machines. In the 1930s and 1940s, electromechanical computers like the <b>Zuse Z3</b> and <strong>Harvard Mark I</strong> were developed, using both mechanical parts and electricity. Soon after, the first generation of electronic computers appeared, built with vacuum tubes. Famous examples include  <u>ENIAC</u>, which was the first general-purpose electronic computer, and

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Generation of Computer</h2>
    <br>
    <p>The <em>history</em> of computers is divided into five generations. The first generation <mark>(1940–1956)</mark> used vacuum tubes, and the machines were very big, slow, and costly. The second generation <mark>(1956–1963)</mark> used transistors, which made computers smaller, faster, and cheaper. The third generation <mark>(1964–1971)</mark> used integrated circuits (ICs), making computers more reliable. The fourth generation <del>(1970-1980)</del> <mark>(1971–1980s)</mark> used microprocessors, and this was the time when personal computers were developed. The fifth generation <mark>(1980s–present)</mark> uses advanced technologies like artificial intelligence, robotics, and powerful microchips. These modern computers are very fast, small, and widely used in our daily life.</p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Birth of Internet</h2>
    <p>The Internet is a global network that connects millions of computers and devices all over the world. It allows people to share information, send messages, watch videos, play games, and do shopping online. Through the Internet, we can access websites, use social media, and learn new things from anywhere at any time. It has made communication very fast and easy with tools like email, video calls, and chat apps. Today, the Internet is an important part of daily life for education, business, entertainment, and social connection</p>

    <br>
    <p>The Internet is the biggest network in the world that connects computers, mobile phones, and many other smart devices together. It started as a small project in the 1960s called ARPANET, but today it has grown to connect millions of people worldwide. The Internet helps us to share information, send emails, watch videos, play games, listen to music, and even study from home. With the Internet, people can use websites, apps, and social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or YouTube to stay connected with friends and family. It is also very useful in business, banking, shopping, and government services, making life easier and faster. Search engines like Google help us find any information we want in seconds. The Internet works with technologies like servers, browsers, Wi-Fi, and mobile data to connect us to this vast digital world. Today, it has become an important part of our daily life, and without it, modern society cannot function properly.</p>
    <blockquote><p>“The Internet is becoming the town square for the global village of tomorrow.”</p>- <cite>Bill Gates</cite></blockquote>
    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Morder Era of Internet</h1>
    <p>The modern era of the Internet is called the digital age or information age. Today, the Internet is not only used for browsing websites but also for almost every part of our life. With the rise of social media platforms, people can easily connect, share ideas, and create content. The Internet has also changed education with online classes and e-learning, business with e-commerce and digital banking, and communication with instant messaging and video calls. Modern Internet also includes advanced technologies like cloud computing, artificial intelligence, big data, and the Internet of Things (IoT), which connect smart devices like watches, cars, and home appliances. High-speed connections like 4G, 5G, and fiber broadband have made the Internet faster and more powerful. This modern era has truly turned the world into a “global village” where information and services are available instantly at our fingertips.</p>
